# Apple's High Yield Savings Account Shakes up Retail Banking Industry

## Overview and Origin

### Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company founded in 1976 April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne[[1]](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11507451/Apple-celebrates-39th-year-on-April-1.html). On August 20, 2019, Apple Inc. revealed their ambitions to expand into the financial services industry with their announcement of the Apple card – a digital first credit card, deeply integrated with Apples ecosystem—in partnership with Goldman Sachs[[2]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-26/apple-card-launches-new-era-of-finance-as-credit-card-debuts) . 
### On October 13, 2022, Apple announced that a new high yield savings account would become available for Apple Card users in the United States in continuation with their Goldman Sachs partnership. The “savings account allows customers to easily set up and manage their savings in their apple card wallet”[[3]](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/04/apple-cards-new-high-yield-savings-account-is-now-available-offering-a-4-point-15-percent-apy/).  
### Apple has significant cash reserves. As of April 1, 2023, Apple reported $54 billion cash on hand.  These reserves enable the company to invest in research and development, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives such as the Apple card and the Apple high yield savings account while maintaining financial stability[[4]](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/32019323000064?cik=320193)

## Business Activities
### “Banks have quickly responded to the Fed's interest rate hikes with higher mortgage and car loan rates, but savers have seen little to no increase in traditional bank deposits or savings accounts,” Says Richard Crone, payments firm Crone Consulting. For consumers, “there's an outflow to CDs, money market funds, and fintechs like Apple.”[[5]](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/32019323000064?cik=320193)
### Apple intends to solve the problem of consumers receiving low returns on savings account deposits by offering an APY of 4.15%. Which, as of April 17, 2023, is a rate that is 10x more than the national average of 0.39%.[[6]](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html#footnote) Traditional regional banks are struggling to maintain net interest margins following the Feds interest rate hikes, so few institutions have matched Apple’s 4.15% on FDIC insured savings account rate.[[7]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/05/01/apples-new-savings-account-draws-nearly-1-billion-in-deposits-in-the-first-four-days/?sh=173d1d0b4e4a) 
### In recent years, Americans have been losing confidence in the stability and solvency of their banks. According to Gallups annual “Confidence in institutions” survey, in 2022 only 27% of Americans reported to have a “great deal or quite a lot” of confidence in their banks. In 1979, that number was 60%. Apple, on the other hand, has been ranked number one for the tenth year in a row in 2022 according to Interbrand’s annual Global Best Brands ranking.[[8]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/04/24/why-apples-partnership-with-goldman-is-the-future-of-banking/?sh=5aaff2fe1304)
### In all of apples financial products, Goldman Sachs operates in the background providing the banking infrastructure, while Apple handles the user interface and integration with its devices. Apple has aimed to differentiate themselves from other financial service providers by focusing on a user-friendly and digital first transactions seamlessly integrated in the iPhone.[[9]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/04/24/why-apples-partnership-with-goldman-is-the-future-of-banking/?sh=5aaff2fe1304)    Other financial services providers in the digital realm will find it difficult to compete with apple as the iPhone does not provide third party applications access to its near-field communication chip, which allows users to make contactless payments through Apple Pay and allows users to securely link credit and debit cards to their apple digital wallet.

## Landscape
### The Apple savings account is the latest product introduced to by the tech giant intended to disrupt the retail banking industry.
### Over the last 5-10 years, the retail banking industry has changed due to the following significant innovations:
### 1.	Digital banking: Banks have expanded their product offerings by investing heavily in online and global banking platforms. These platforms allow customers to access their accounts, make transactions and manage their finances from smartphones and computers. There has been a rise in digital only banks in the United States such as Bask Bank, Current, Varo, and LendingClub.[[10]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/04/24/why-apples-partnership-with-goldman-is-the-future-of-banking/?sh=5aaff2fe1304)  

### 2.	Peer to Peer Payments and Digital Wallets: The popularity of mobile payment solutions has grown significantly. Services like Apple Pay, Google pay, WeChatt Pay, CashApp and Venmo allow users to make payments to merchants or other consumers using only their smartphones.

### 3.	Personalization and Customer Experience: Retail banks have focused on enhancing customer experience by leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence to offer tailored products and services to customers.

## Results 
### As the Apple Savings account was just recently launched on April 17, 2023, its difficult to assess the impact the product has on the retail banking industry so far, but since bank deposits are an essential metric for assessing savings accounts in the retail banking industry, we can take an early look.
### Apple's savings account went live during a time of intense competition to attract and keep deposits after a cascade of regional bank failures. First Republic Bank is the most recent financial institution to fail, reportedly losing $100 billion in deposits during the panic in April.[[11]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/04/24/why-apples-partnership-with-goldman-is-the-future-of-banking/?sh=5aaff2fe1304)  On March 9, Silicon Valley bank, which contained a retail segment, saw customers withdraw $42 billion in a single day. As for Apple, their savings account was launched on April 17 2023, and it brought in nearly a billion dollars worth of deposits in the first 4 days the feature was live.[[12]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/05/01/apples-new-savings-account-draws-nearly-1-billion-in-deposits-in-the-first-four-days/?sh=173d1d0b4e4a) 

## Recomendations
### For Apple to secure their place in the retail financial services space they will need to continue to expand their product offerings. One such offering that would benefit the company and could seamlessly blend into the iPhone digital wallet would be zero commission stock and ETF trading. 
### Consumers have already proven to be comfortable making investments on their smartphones as shown by other online zero commission brokerages such as RobinHood and WealthSimple Trade. Alongside this offering Apple could leverage AI trained robo-advisors to provide advice and help customers construct optimal low-cost portfolios.
### An online brokerage would make Apples financial offering more comprehensive. A more comprehensive product suite would attract new customers, bringing in more deposits for their cash accounts, while also driving revenue using the payment-for-order-flow business model of other zero commission brokerages.
